# Changelog

Versions are the plugin's, in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## 0.17.0

`comfyui-asset-generation` grows the MiniMax H3 path that transfers motion from a reference clip
onto a character, and hardens the two scripts around it.

- **`reference/h3-motion-transfer.md`** — one input owns identity and wardrobe, the other owns
  motion, cadence and framing, and the prompt says which is which. Why a 60 fps reference passed
  through unchanged softens the cadence, what to write instead of "fast" when timing matters, and
  a QA pass that compares motion phase at matching timestamps in a synchronized side-by-side
  rather than trusting a successful `/prompt`.
- **`scripts/prepare_h3_motion_reference.py`** — a motion reference normalized to 24 fps and an
  exact 17k+5 frame count, then read back with `ffprobe` and refused unless the frame count, rate
  and codecs are what was asked for. Audio is dropped by default; `--keep-audio` keeps it and
  verifies the track covers the whole timeline. A source too short to fill the requested frames is
  rejected before ffmpeg runs, naming the duration it would need.
- **`scripts/comfy_asset_client.py`** — `upload_image` is now `upload_asset`, because video and
  audio inputs go through the same endpoint and field name. The run reports `vram_after_unload`
  from `/system_stats`; a failure to read it no longer discards the outputs of a job that
  succeeded.

## 0.16.0

Thirty-six skills. Two new ones cover the part of the loop that happens **on a phone on your
desk** — the part an editor-side harness cannot reach.

- **`unity-device-testing`** — acceptance on a real Android or iOS device from a terminal. A probe
  scene that logs one tagged line per state change and one `k=v` line per second; an `adb` driver
  and a `devicectl` driver that assert on those lines with a timeout per step; system dialogs found
  by window focus and tapped by coordinates that respect rotation; physical steps (unplug, replug,
  background) detected **from the device** so a latency assertion starts at the real event; files
  pulled back from `persistentDataPath` on both platforms; and three exit codes — pass, a verdict
  about the app, a broken harness. Its pre-flight names the five things that look like bugs and are
  not: a dozing screen, a stale install, another app holding the hardware, an adb server restarted
  by a headless build, and a presence check that reads history instead of the present.
- **`unity-ios-build`** — from a Unity project to a process on an iPhone without opening Xcode:
  the headless build that produces an Xcode project and nothing else, an unsigned compile gate that
  needs no device, signing decided by the intersection of certificate, profile and device on this
  Mac (`doctor` prints it; the id in a certificate's name is a person, not a team), `devicectl`
  install, and `--console` as the only log channel. Native `.mm` plugins: the `.meta`, the
  `__Internal` import with stubs elsewhere, Objective-C exceptions being off, and iterating native
  code in 30 seconds by syncing into the generated project. App Store submission is out of scope.
- **Neighbours route to them.** `unity-android-release`, `unity-debug`, `unity-play-harness` and
  `unity-cli` each gained the row that hands you over.

## 0.15.0

Thirty-four load-by-situation skills, each teaching the same three things: what to check, the call
that checks it, and the script that does it for you.

- **`unity-urp-migration`** — a Built-in Render Pipeline project moved to URP in five gated phases,
  every gate read back from the **saved** project rather than from the converter log, plus the four
  traps that let a half-moved project report success: an assignment that sits in Graphics settings
  but not in the quality tiers, 3D materials claimed by the 2D shader provider, a Volume profile
  that reloads empty because its overrides were never added as sub-assets, and lighting that is
  still Built-in baked data.
- **`unity-search`** — a *find / where is / which prefabs use / what references X* question turned
  into one Unity Search query: asset type filters, folders, labels, `ref=` relationships and scene
  component queries, written out before it runs and opened in a live Editor when one is reachable.
  Read-only — it never selects, moves or edits a result.
- **`unity-cli` grows the two surfaces a repo hits first.** `reference/version-control.md` covers
  the verbs that know what a scene is — `vcs diff` and `blame` by object and field with their
  identity-confidence levels, `merge-setup` and its `--check` exit, `sync`/`switch` refusing while
  an Editor holds the project, `affected`/`summarize` and why their answer is a lower bound, and
  the three different meanings of `--since`. `reference/ci-preflight.md` covers `unity ci init`,
  the `doctor --ci` exit codes that say whether a retry is honest, and `cache key`.
- **The TMP Essentials import no longer hard-codes a package path.** `unity-localization` scans
  `Library/PackageCache` for the resource package instead, and names the menu item that returns
  `true` and then blocks a headless run on a modal dialog.
- **Smaller additions across the UI, 2D, runtime and backend skills** — USS patterns, sprite and
  atlas scripts, NavMesh areas and costs, a URP pre-flight snippet, package selection, and the
  documentation maps the services SDKs publish.
- **One layout for every skill.** `SKILL.md` is a router with a symptom table; `reference/` holds
  the depth it names; `resources/`, `scripts/` and `templates/` hold what you run or copy. No skill
  keeps content at its own root.
- **Every section is a method section** — what to check and how to check it, in present tense,
  never a record of how this repo checked it. A doubt that should change what you do is written as
  a step you run, not as a hedge.
- **Package tables** keep ids and API floors, and point at `Packages/packages-lock.json` for what
  actually resolved.
- **Skills route to each other, never out of the repo.** Each one's `Scope — what this skill does
  NOT do` section hands you to the right neighbour, so you land in the right skill from any
  direction.
- **Gates, run by CI on every push and pull request:** `tools/lint-skills.py` (frontmatter, name
  matches directory, shipped executables parse), `tools/check-consistency.py` (the two manifests
  agree, every route out of this repo is declared) and `tools/sync-codex-manifests.py` (the Codex
  manifests are generated — never hand-edit them).
